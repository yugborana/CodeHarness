"""Subagents: exploration that happens somewhere else.

A subagent is a whole agent loop with its own message list. That list is never
shown to the main agent and never outlives the call - the only thing that
crosses back is the final report.

That is the entire point, and it is compact.py's idea from the other end.
Exploring a repo burns tens of thousands of tokens of tool output to produce a
few hundred tokens of answer. compact.py throws context away after it has been
spent; a subagent spends it somewhere that gets thrown away by design, so the
main transcript never pays for the difference at all.

Four rules, and the code below is really just these:

  1. it starts from an empty history          (no memory of anything)
  2. it holds every tool but two              (no recursion, no touching the plan)
  3. it runs the same loop as the main agent  (nothing special happens here)
  4. only its last message comes back         (the rest is discarded)
"""

import os

MAX_TURNS = 12  # a runaway explorer is worse than a missing answer


# --- rule 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------
# `task` would let a subagent spawn subagents, forever. `write_todos` writes to
# a module global that belongs to the main agent's plan, and this one is a
# guest in someone else's session. Everything else it gets.
#
# Note this is a *structural* guarantee - those tools are simply not in the
# list it is offered, so it cannot call them. The "do not edit files" rule in
# the prompt below is only asking nicely. To make that one structural too, add
# write_file and str_replace to this set.
WITHHELD = {"task", "write_todos", "str_replace", "write"}


SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""
You are an exploration subagent. You were given one question by a lead agent
and you answer it. That is the whole job.

You cannot see the conversation that spawned you, and the lead agent cannot
see anything you do here. Only your final message crosses back, so it has to
stand on its own.

You are working in {os.getcwd()}. Search inside it. Never search from / or
from the home directory - that scans the whole machine and will time out.

How to work:
- Use bash, read_file and read_skill to find out what is actually true.
  Prefer rg, grep and find to guess at where things live.
- You are here to read and report, not to change anything. Do not write or
  edit files, and do not run commands with side effects.
- Search in batches. Several greps in one turn beats one grep per turn.
- Stop as soon as you can answer. Do not keep looking to be thorough.

Your final message is the entire report, and it is the only thing that costs
the lead agent anything - so keep it short. Aim for under 150 words. Findings
only: file paths with line numbers, names, values. No preamble, no restating
the question, no long code blocks - cite the path and line and let the lead
agent open it. Say plainly what you could not find; a gap is useful, a guess
is not.
