"""Keeping the transcript small enough to send.

Three mechanisms, cheapest first. Only the first two live here; the expensive
one is compact.py.

1. cap    - a fresh tool result is trimmed and the full text parked in a temp
            file the agent can page through. Free: the decision is made once,
            when the result is created, so it never edits the prefix.
2. strip  - once a turn is over, its tool results shrink to a stub. The edit
            lands at the tail, right before the next user message, so the
            cached prefix in front of it survives.
3. drop   - a single request is still too big. Throw tool results away whole,
            oldest first, until it fits.

Everything here refuses to touch the locked prefix - the frozen
system + summary + head that compaction leaves behind. That block has to stay
byte-identical to stay cached.
